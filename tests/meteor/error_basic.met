# Test error handling basic parsing and execution
# Based on RFC-003 Section 3

# Define an error enum
error IOError
    NotFound
    PermissionDenied

# Test try/catch (simplified - just print in try block for now)
try
    print("In try block")
catch IOError.NotFound
    print("Caught NotFound")

print("Error handling test passed!")
